It's a battle snake I created for the Battle Snake Saskatchewan competition on the (https://play.battlesnake.com)[battle snake] platform.

First time using python. It's a fun language but it is no java. 

Snake primarily uses BFS and a bunch of other random things I made up. It uses a wacky scoring system to makes its final decision that did it no favours in the competition.
