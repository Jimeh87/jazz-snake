## [Jazz snake](https://play.battlesnake.com/profile/jim)

It's a battle snake I created for the Battle Snake Saskatchewan competition on the [battle snake](https://play.battlesnake.com) platform.

First time using python. It's a fun language but it is no java.

Snake primarily uses BFS and a bunch of other random things I made up. It uses a wacky scoring system to makes its final decision that did it no favours in the competition.

### Now listen to some [snake jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v26_pOpZDw0)


### Developer notes

* Start snake: `python server.py`
* Expose local port: `ngrok http 8080`
  * Will need to update snake config to point to new url
